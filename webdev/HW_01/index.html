		<h1>An Example of A Static Website</h1>
		<iframe src="http://www.mhp2g.com/weapon/index.html" width="900" height="450"></iframe>
		<p>This is a static website becasue it is written using the Hypertext Markup Language and each web page is a separate document.</p>
		<p>I like it because the user interface is simple. I can find what I want easily.</p>

		<h2>A Example of A Dynamic Website</h2>
		<iframe src="https://www.reddit.com/" width="900"></iframe>
		<p>Reddit is a dynamic website because there is a large amount of content uploaded to its database every day.</p>
		<p>I like it because I can immediately interact with other people through its website.</p>
